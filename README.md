## Description
The Applied Data Science program at Syracuse University is designed to teach students the skills necessary to become professionals who can analyze data to solve problems. I will demonstrate the achievement of the learning goals of the program through projects from the following courses: Introduction to Data Science, Applied Machine Learning, and Scripting for Data Analysis. The learning goals are as follows:
<br>
•	Collect, store, and access data by identifying and leveraging applicable technologies<br>
•	Create actionable insight across a range of contexts (e.g. societal, business, political), using data and the full data science life cycle<br>
•	Apply visualization and predictive models to help generate actionable insight<br>
•	Use programming languages such as Rand Python to support the generation of actionable insight<br>
•	Communicate insights gained via visualization and analytics to a broad range of audiences (including project sponsors and technical team leads<br>
•	Apply ethics in the development, use and evaluation of data and predictive models (e.g., fairness, bias, transparency, privacy)<br>
