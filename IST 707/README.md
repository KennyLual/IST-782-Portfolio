# Corn Yield Prediction Using Meteorological and Market Data

This machine learning project predicts corn yields in Iowa using historical weather patterns and biodiesel market data. Random Forest Regressor models were applied for forecasting and variable importance analysis.

## Files Included
- `corn_yield_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with full data processing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation
- `yield_prediction_flowchart.png`: Visual summary of key influencing factors
- `Final_Project_Report.pdf`: Technical report summarizing modeling approach and results

## Software Required
- Jupyter Notebook or compatible IDE
- Python 3.8+ with the following libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

## Notes
- Weather data was sourced from 90 Iowa stations.
- USDA data was used for yield outcomes.
- Feature engineering was critical to model success.
