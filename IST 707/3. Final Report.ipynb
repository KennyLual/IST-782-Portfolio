    "## Introduction\n",
    "Corn is more than just a crop in Iowa. As one of the leading producers in the United States, Iowa's farmers rely on its rich soil and favorable climate. However, they face challenges from unpredictable weather, varying soil conditions, and market fluctuations. Accurate yield predictions are essential for farmers to plan their strategies and ensure food security for their communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach integrates historical corn production data with biofuel trends and environmental factors, employing supervised machine learning techniques to enhance accuracy. This proposal seeks to leverage ML techniques to forecast corn yields in Iowa, empowering farmers and policymakers with actionable data to optimize their practices and promote sustainability in the face of a changing climate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Primary Stakeholder\n",
    "The primary stakeholders in this project are Iowa's farmers, who depend on accurate corn yield predictions to make informed decisions about planting and resource allocation. Their economic viability and sustainability hinge on these forecasts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other stakeholders are agricultural organizations and policymakers including government agencies, such as Dept. of Agriculture, which will use the insights generated to develop strategies that enhance food security and promote sustainable practices."

    "## Literature Review\n",
    "\n",
    "The intersection of agriculture and machine learning has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in crop yield prediction. While many studies have demonstrated the efficacy of machine learning techniques for forecasting crop production, few have adequately addressed the relationship between corn yields and biofuel trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous research often relies on regression models, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to analyze climate factors and their impact on crop yields. For instance, studies have shown how variables such as weather patterns and soil characteristics influence yields by examining their non-linear relationships[^1]. However, these studies typically overlook the critical role of biofuel markets and their fluctuations, which can significantly affect corn production decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the importance of feature selection and engineering in enhancing model performance has been emphasized. A study by Kumar demonstrated that incorporating indicators like soil health and climate forecasts significantly improved the predictive power of machine learning models[^2]. Ensemble methods have emerged as powerful tools in agricultural predictions, with studies indicating that combining multiple models can yield more robust predictions by leveraging the strengths of individual approaches[^3][^4]. Yet, the inclusion of biofuel consumption trends remains largely absent, despite its potential impact on corn demand and agricultural practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while existing research underscores the promise of machine learning in improving corn yield predictions, there is a significant opportunity to enhance these models by incorporating biofuel trends. By leveraging both historical and real-time data, including biofuel trend, our approach aims to empower farmers and stakeholders to make more informed decisions.\n",

    "\n",
    "The goal was to develop a predictive model that incorporates environmental, historical, and biofuel market data to forecast corn yields, providing valuable insights for farmers and policymakers. The modeling process included data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target Variable\n",
    "The target variable for this regression task is the Value column in the dataset, which represents the corn yield. The goal is to predict this variable based on a set of features that include both environmental factors (such as precipitation, temperature) and biofuel market data (such as biodiesel and diesel prices).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preprocessing\n",
    "A lot of the work was spent getting the data ready for modeling. We had to do a bunch of preprocessing steps to make sure the dataset was clean, consistent, and ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Handling Missing Values: The dataset had missing values in the “precipitation” column. To address this, we used the mean imputation method. The mean was chosen because the missing precipitation values were not missing at random, so imputing with the mean preserved the overall data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Removing Duplicates: Duplicate rows were removed from the dataset to ensure the model doesn’t overemphasize certain data points, which could lead to biased predictions. This was necessary since the dataset was merged.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Encoding Categorical Variables: The dataset contained categorical features, such as Region and Stations. These were converted to a numerical format using one-hot encoding. Each region and station was converted into a set of binary features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scaling/Normalizing Data: Machine learning algorithms sensitive to feature scale were feature scaled using StandardScaler from scikit-learn. Numerical features like Biodiesel, Diesel, Price Difference, precipitation, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature were normalized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which is crucial for distance-based models.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "![Distribution of Value](downloaddddd.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Selection\n",
    "We looked into a bunch of different ways to predict corn yield (Value). In the end, we picked the Random Forest Regressor, which is a really popular way to do ensemble learning. I’ll tell you all about how we chose and tweaked this model, as well as the other methods we tried that didn’t work as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initial Model Selection: Initially, we explored linear regression as a baseline model to understand the relationship between the features and the target variable. Linear regression is simple and interpretable but did not fully capture the complex non-linear relationships that exists in our data given the diverse nature of the features. Linear regression was found to be insufficient for accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Random Forest Regressor: As an alternative, we chose the Random Forest Regressor. Random Forest is known for its ability to handle non-linear relationships, interactions between features, and overfitting problems. It is better at allowing us to assess which factors are most impactful in predicting corn yields.After initial testing, the results were unsatisfactory so we decided to do some hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV to optimize the Random Forest Regressor:\n",
    "    * max_depth = [None, 10, 20, 30]: We chose to test these different depths to find the best balance. Restricting the depth of each tree to prevent overfitting and force the model to generalize better.\n",
    "    * min_samples_leaf = [1, 2, 4]: We specified these minimum number of samples to vary how strict the model is about the number of samples needed at the leaf nodes.\n",
    "    * min_samples_split = [2, 5, 10]: We chose these minimum number of samples to better control how conservative the trees should be when deciding whether to split.\n",
    "    * n_estimators = [50, 100, 200]: We chose to test these three values because more trees improve performance, but also testing a range to find the optimal tradeoff between performance and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model Training: The Random Forest Regressor was trained on 80% of the dataset (split using train_test_split) and evaluated on the remaining 20%. The model was fit to the training data, and predictions were made on the test data to assess performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Cross-Validation: To ensure that the model is even more robust and not overfitting to a specific training set, we performed 5-fold cross-validation. We divided the training data into five subsets, trained the model on four of them and tested on the remaining one. The process was repeated five times, and the average performance score is computed. Cross-validation is particularly useful for gauging the stability of the model and avoiding overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods That Were Explored But Not Used\n",
    "1. Gradient Boosting: we also experimented with Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), but while this is known for its high accuracy in many regression tasks, tit was computationally expensive and did not provide significant improvements over Random Forest in this specific application. The tuning process for gradient boosting models are more complex, and the added computation time did not justify the marginal performance improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Support Vector Machines (SVM): Another approach considered was Support Vector Machines (SVM), which are effective in high-dimensional spaces. However, due to the large number of features (after one-hot encoding), SVMs struggled with long training times and were less interpretable compared to Random Forest. Additionally, SVM models require careful tuning of hyperparameters such as the kernel type and regularization parameter, and the complexity of these models didn’t offer substantial gains for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Model Choice\n",
    "The Random Forest Regressor performed best due to its balance of accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency. The final model achieved strong test set performance with reasonable MSE and R² values. Feature importance provided insights into the key factors affecting corn yield, with features like prec (precipitation), Biodiesel, and tmax (maximum temperature) identified as the most influential predictors. These results were visualized using a bar plot.\n"

    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us discuss the model’s performance, focusing on evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (R²), and feature importance. The Random Forest Regressor model, after we trained and evaluated it using the preprocessed dataset, was assessed using a variety of metrics to measure its predictive accuracy and generalizability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Evaluation\n",
    "To evaluate the model’s performance, we used Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) as the primary metrics. We compared the model’s predictions to the actual values in the test set to assess its accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Squared Error (MSE):  The MSE value on the test set was 0.04 when used the Linear Regression model and then 6.622 when used the Random Forest Regressor model and finally -3.686. This reflects the model's average squared deviation from the actual corn yield values in the test set. The goal was to minimize this error to improve predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared (R²):  The R² score on the test set was  0.953 when used the Linear Regression model and then 0.999 when used the Random Forest Regressor model. This suggests that 95% of the variation in corn yields is explained by the model, indicating a moderate to high level of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualizations\n",
    "To provide further insight into the model’s performance, several visualizations were created:\n",
    "Actual vs Predicted Values: A scatter plot was created to compare the actual corn yield values to the predicted values. A perfect model would produce predictions that lie along the diagonal line (where predicted = actual). The scatter plot allows us to visually assess the model's accuracy.\n",
    "The plot shows a reasonably tight grouping around the diagonal, indicating that the model performs well, though some deviations can be observed, especially for extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Actual vs Predicted Values](./download.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Importance: Feature importance scores were extracted from the trained Random Forest model, revealing which features had the most significant impact on predicting corn yields. The following features were found to be most important:\n",

    "![Feature Importance](./downloadd.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Validation Performance: Cross-validation was performed using 5-fold cross-validation to assess the stability and generalizability of the model. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) from each fold was recorded and the distribution of these MSE values was visualized in a boxplot.\n",
    "The cross-validation scores showed some variation, and overall, the model's performance improved very well across different folds.\n",

While there is always room for further improvement, particularly in predicting extreme low or high corn yields, the current accuracy is strong enough for practical use. Fine-tuning the model or exploring alternative methods, such as Gradient Boosting, could potentially enhance performance, especially when handling outliers. However, the existing results are already robust and should provide reliable predictions in most scenarios.\n",

    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project demonstrates the potential of applying machine learning models to agricultural forecasting, specifically in predicting corn yields in Iowa. By integrating historical corn production data, climate variables, and biodiesel market trends, we successfully developed a predictive model using the Random Forest Regressor. This model effectively captured complex, non-linear relationships, making it well-suited for understanding the multifaceted factors influencing corn production. Throughout the modeling process, our approach balanced prediction accuracy with interpretability, ensuring that the results could be easily understood by both agricultural experts and policymakers. The feature importance analysis revealed that environmental factors such as precipitation, maximum temperature, and biodiesel prices were the most critical variables in predicting corn yields. This finding highlights the dual role of environmental conditions and market dynamics in shaping agricultural outcomes. Farmers and policymakers can use this information to monitor key variables, adjust resource allocations, and plan for weather or market-induced disruptions. Furthermore, our preprocessing steps—such as scaling, encoding categorical features, and handling missing data—were essential for ensuring a clean and prepared dataset. These steps contributed to the model’s strong performance by reducing biases and improving generalization across different regions in Iowa. Our work underscores the potential of combining historical and real-time data sources to create actionable insights for the agricultural sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the promising results, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, the scope of the dataset was confined to Iowa’s corn production, climate, and biodiesel prices from 2015 to 2022, limiting the generalizability of our findings to other regions or longer timeframes. Incorporating a broader geographic range and an extended historical dataset could enhance the model’s predictive power. Second, while biodiesel prices were included as a market factor, other critical economic indicators such as export demand, trade policies, and global commodity prices were excluded due to data unavailability. These factors likely influence corn yields and should be considered in future analyses. Additionally, our model did not include critical agronomic data such as soil health, land management practices, or crop rotation patterns, all of which have a significant impact on agricultural productivity. The climate data used, though region-specific, lacked fine-grained geographic details like farm-level microclimates, limiting the model’s ability to account for localized weather variations. Lastly, while Random Forest provided valuable feature importance rankings, its interpretability remains limited compared to simpler models like linear regression. This could pose challenges for policymakers and agricultural stakeholders less familiar with machine learning concepts, suggesting a need for clearer, more intuitive model explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "To build on our project’s success, several areas of future work could further enhance the model’s accuracy and usability. Expanding the dataset to include additional economic variables such as global corn prices, export demand, and government subsidies would enable a more comprehensive understanding of market-driven influences on corn yields. Integrating detailed agronomic features such as soil properties, irrigation methods, and planting schedules could improve the model’s predictive accuracy by considering key agricultural management practices. Real-time forecasting capabilities could be developed by incorporating continuously updated climate forecasts and biofuel price indices, allowing the model to provide dynamic predictions and early alerts for farmers. From a technical perspective, future efforts could explore more advanced machine learning models such as Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machines (SVM), or even deep learning approaches for better performance, provided that computational costs remain manageable. Finally, a policy impact analysis could be conducted by simulating how changes in agricultural policies—such as biofuel subsidies or environmental regulations—might affect corn production. This would provide policymakers with actionable insights into the long-term implications of different policy scenarios, helping to ensure sustainable agricultural development in Iowa and beyond."
